## 🚀 About Me

💭 There's no perfect moment to start your journey. My path in IT has been a winding road, filled with growth and unexpected turns.

🌅 My journey began with a solid foundation in computer science, leading me to explore various aspects of software development. From my early days of coding to now working with cutting-edge technologies like React.js and IoT, it's been an exciting ride.

🚀 A pivotal moment in my career was joining **Four Tuples Solution** as a Backend Developer. There, I had the opportunity to oversee back-end development using PHP, ensuring website integrity, security, and efficiency. This experience allowed me to hone my skills in both server-side programming and database management, particularly with MySQL for effective data storage and retrieval. I gained valuable experience in planning website development, transforming mock-ups into functional web interfaces, and integrating them with databases. Additionally, I developed proficiency in REST APIs and agile methodologies, showcasing my skills in API development and comprehensive testing using Postman. This role not only enhanced my technical abilities but also provided me with valuable experience in team management and leadership, fostering a collaborative and innovative work environment.

🎓 Driven by my passion for technology, I pursued a Master's in Information Technology at **Central Queensland University**. This educational journey has equipped me with advanced knowledge in web development, enterprise systems, and database management.

💻 I'm committed to continuous learning and problem-solving. I thrive on creating efficient, user-friendly software solutions that make a real difference.
